# Professional Practice Codes

This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed for the Professional Practice course under the guidance of Professor 李亚楠. These projects include implementations of classic games and exercises that strengthened my programming skills. I am proud to have achieved the highest grade in my class for this course.

## Repository Structure

### Python Projects

- **number guessing game.py** - A guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly chosen number within a certain range. This project introduces basic conditional logic and random number generation.
- **clock.py** - A Python script that displays a real-time clock or performs time-based calculations, demonstrating handling of time-based functions.
- **spinner.py** - Displays a spinning loading animation in the console. This simple project involves basic loops and console manipulation.
- **card game.py** - A simple card game where players draw cards and compete to get the highest card value, introducing basic game rules and randomization.
- **creat_document.py** - Generates a text document with predefined or user-input content, showcasing file handling and user input.
- **tic tac toe.py** - The classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking X's and O's on a 3x3 grid. This project involves game logic and a basic understanding of lists.
- **snake.py** - A recreation of the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. This project introduces more advanced game logic and basic graphics.
- **five-in-a-row.py** - A strategic game that challenges players to align five pieces consecutively on a board, involving a more complex game algorithm and strategic planning.
- **Tetris.py** - A Python implementation of the iconic Tetris game, focusing on game logic and graphics, with a need for managing shapes and scoring.
- **Hazimo Raad.py** - Contains specific code implementations for class-assigned tasks. This personal project is tailored to specific requirements, making it the most complex due to its customized nature and the unique challenges involved.

Each project demonstrates a variety of skills, from handling game logic and creating interactive elements to managing data structures and improving code efficiency.

## Getting Started

To explore these projects:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/professional-practice-codes.git
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   cd professional-practice-codes
   source myvenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Run any of the Python scripts** to see the projects in action. For example:
   ```bash
   python Tetris.py
   ```

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Professor 李亚楠 for providing these engaging projects and for their guidance throughout the course. Completing these projects has been instrumental in strengthening my Python programming skills.
