# Professional Practice Codes

This repository contains a collection of Python projects developed for the Professional Practice course under the guidance of Professor 李亚楠. These projects include implementations of classic games and exercises that strengthened my programming skills. I am proud to have achieved the highest grade in my class for this course.

## Repository Structure

### Python Projects

- **Tetris.py** - A Python implementation of the iconic Tetris game, focusing on game logic and graphics.
- **snake.py** - A recreation of the classic Snake game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer.
- **five-in-a-row.py** - A strategic game that challenges players to align five pieces consecutively on a board.
- **Hazimo Raad.py** - Contains specific code implementations for class-assigned tasks.

Each project demonstrates a variety of skills, from handling game logic and creating interactive elements to managing data structures and improving code efficiency.

## Getting Started

To explore these projects:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/professional-practice-codes.git
   ```

2. **Set up the virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   cd professional-practice-codes
   source myvenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Run any of the Python scripts** to see the projects in action:
   ```bash
   python Tetris.py
   ```

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Professor 李亚楠 for providing these engaging projects and for their guidance throughout the course. Completing these projects has been instrumental in strengthening my Python programming skills.
